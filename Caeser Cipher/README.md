The **Caesar Cipher** is a simple encryption method where each letter in the message is shifted by a certain number of places in the alphabet. For example, if the shift is 3, the letter 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on. It’s a substitution cipher, which means it replaces each letter with another one based on the key (the number of positions to shift). The Caesar Cipher is easy to understand and was used by Julius Caesar to protect his messages. While it’s not secure by today’s standards, it’s a great way to introduce the basic idea of encryption and how data can be hidden by shifting letters in a simple way.
