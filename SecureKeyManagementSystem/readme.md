# Secure Key Management System

This project implements a secure key management system using cryptographic techniques, including symmetric key encryption, asymmetric key encryption (RSA), and Diffie-Hellman key exchange. It also includes key revocation functionality to enhance security.

## Features
- **Symmetric Key Generation**: Generates a 256-bit key for fast encryption.
- **Asymmetric Key Generation**: Uses RSA-2048 for secure communication.
- **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**: Establishes a shared secret key securely.
- **RSA Encryption & Decryption**: Encrypts and decrypts messages securely.
- **Key Revocation**: Allows secure deletion of private keys.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies.

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install cryptography
```

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or copy the script.
2. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python secure_key_management.py
   ```
3. Enter a message when prompted.
4. The program will display the original message, encrypted message, and decrypted message.
5. The private key will then be revoked, and any further decryption attempts will fail.

## Example Output
```
Enter the message to encrypt: Hello, World!
Original Message: Hello, World!
Encrypted Message: b'...encrypted text...'
Decrypted Message: Hello, World!

Revoking Private Key...
Key Revoked

Decrypted Message after Revocation: Error: Private Key is revoked and cannot be used.
```

## Security Considerations
- Uses **AES-256** for symmetric encryption.
- Implements **RSA-2048** for asymmetric encryption.
- Uses **Diffie-Hellman** for secure key exchange.
- Supports **key revocation** to prevent unauthorized access.
