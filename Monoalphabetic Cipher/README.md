# Hybrid Encryption Using Playfair and Columnar Transposition Cipher

## Overview
This project implements a hybrid encryption technique that combines the **Playfair cipher** and the **Columnar Transposition cipher** to enhance security. The Playfair cipher is a substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters, while the Columnar Transposition cipher is a permutation cipher that rearranges characters based on a given key.

---

## Features
- Encrypts plaintext using a hybrid approach.
- Decrypts ciphertext back to the original plaintext.
- Implements Playfair cipher for substitution-based encryption.
- Implements Columnar Transposition cipher for permutation-based encryption.
- Handles key-based encryption and decryption.

[Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WgM6A-Zjb3iPdtOY6HN3kqdar-Z06XE9#scrollTo=psjSKppkoSxo)

### Running Locally
#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NumPy library (for matrix operations)

#### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hybrid-encryption.git
   cd hybrid-encryption
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install numpy
   ```

#### Usage
Run the script in a terminal:
```sh
python encrypt_decrypt.py
```

---

## Inputs
The program will prompt the user for:
- **Playfair key** (A keyword used to generate the Playfair matrix)
- **Transposition key** (A word used to define the column order for transposition cipher)
- **Plaintext** (Message to be encrypted)

---

## Encryption Process
1. The Playfair cipher encrypts the plaintext into an intermediate ciphertext.
2. The Columnar Transposition cipher further encrypts the intermediate text to produce the final ciphertext.

## Decryption Process
1. The Columnar Transposition cipher is reversed to retrieve the intermediate text.
2. The Playfair cipher is reversed to retrieve the original plaintext.

---

## Example
```sh
Enter Playfair key: KEYWORD
Enter Transposition key: SECRET
Enter Plaintext: HELLO WORLD
Encrypted Text: WXYZ...
Decrypted Text: HELXLOWORLD
```
**Note:** The letter 'X' may be used for padding in the Playfair cipher.

## Monoalphabetic Cipher
The **Monoalphabetic Cipher** is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter from a fixed substitution alphabet. The key in this cipher is the mapping between the original alphabet and the cipher alphabet. Unlike the Caesar Cipher, where each letter is shifted by a fixed number, the Monoalphabetic Cipher allows for a random or pre-defined substitution for each letter.

### **Steps to Run the Monoalphabetic Cipher Code on GitHub:**
1. Run code on Colab: [Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HZXvLp3TbH-yOe4qArm4R1O7vAzmnK4D)

2. **Alternate method to run:**
   
   **Set Up GitHub Codespaces**:
   - Open the repository in **GitHub Codespaces** by clicking on the **Code** button and selecting **Open with Codespaces**.

   **Compile and Run the Code in Codespaces**:
   - Once you're in Codespaces, open the terminal.
   - Compile the code by running:
     ```sh
     gcc monoalphabetic_cipher.c -o monoalphabetic_cipher
     ```
   - Run the compiled code:
     ```sh
     ./monoalphabetic_cipher
     ```
   
   **Enter Inputs**:
   - The program will ask for the **length of the string** and the **string itself** to be encrypted or decrypted. 
   - Example input for encryption:
     ```sh
     Enter the length of string to be encrypted: 5
     Enter the string to encrypt: hello
     ```
     
     **View Output**:
     ```sh
     Encrypted string: qtmmp
     ```

     **Decrypt the string:**
   - You can then enter the encrypted message to decrypt it:
     ```sh
     Enter the length of string to be decrypted: 5
     Enter the string to decrypt: qtmmp
     ```
     ```sh
     The decrypted string: hello
     ```

The Monoalphabetic Cipher is a simple encryption technique that replaces each letter in the plaintext with a corresponding letter from a cipher alphabet. While easy to understand and implement, it is not considered secure due to its vulnerability to frequency analysis. However, it serves as an introductory exercise in cryptography and helps demonstrate how substitution ciphers work.
